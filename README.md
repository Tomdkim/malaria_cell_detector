# malaria_cell_detector

Tom Kim's first deep learning personal project

Goal of this project: To build a convolutional neural network model that would detect malaria infected cells with a high accuracy. Save the world!

About the original dataset:
- Name: Malaria Cell Images Dataset
- One folder of images of malaria infected cells & the other of images of uninfected cells (a total of 27,558 images)
- Acknowledgement -- this dataset is taken from the official NIH website
- Dataset can be downloaded @ https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
